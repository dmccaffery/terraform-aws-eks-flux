# An ECR pull-through cache of the platform artifact store, deployed in a
# consuming team's own account and region.
#
# This is the default way a cluster reaches the store. The store itself admits
# only the ECR pull-through cache service, org-wide (aws:PrincipalOrgID), so a
# new account onboards by applying this module rather than by editing the
# store's principal list. Images are then pulled from a registry in the same
# account and region as the nodes: no cross-account data path at pull time, no
# cross-region egress, and the store stays closed to direct reads.
#
# The cache materialises each repository on its FIRST pull, which is why every
# puller (kubelet, the flux controllers, kyverno) needs ecr:CreateRepository and
# ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage as well as read - see the consumer_policy output.
#
# Digests are preserved end to end, so cosign verification works through the
# cache exactly as it does against the store: signatures are ordinary tagged
# manifests (sha256-<digest>.sig) that pull through with everything else.
