# The flux bootstrap chain: three helm releases, so a single terraform apply
# takes an empty cluster to a reconciling GitOps platform without any
# kubernetes_manifest plan-time CRD problems - 
#
#   1. flux-operator     the operator + its CRDs (FluxInstance, ResourceSet, ...)
#   2. cluster-inputs    the terraform -> flux-manifests contract (local chart):
#                        the cluster-vars ConfigMap and pre-created namespaces
#   3. flux-instance     renders the FluxInstance CR; the operator materialises
#                        the Flux controllers and the sync OCIRepository from it
#
# Everything is pulled from the platform registry (charts/flux-operator,
# charts/flux-instance, mirrored fluxcd controller images), so the artifact
# store must be populated by flux-containers before the first bootstrap.
#
# The operator and instance releases are BOOTSTRAP-ONLY (ignore_changes): the
# manifests' flux component adopts both by release name and follows the newest
# mirrored charts from then on, so a flux-containers publish -- never a
# terraform apply -- is what upgrades flux on a running cluster.
# cluster_inputs stays terraform-reconciled: cluster-vars changes flow through
# applies.
