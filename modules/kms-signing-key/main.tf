# An asymmetric KMS key for cosign signing of platform artifacts.
#
# This is the key the artifact-store module's signing_kms_key_arn and the
# cluster module's signed_identity.kms_key_arn both point at when signing is
# KMS-based rather than keyless. It lives in its own module because the signing
# identity must outlive any one store or cluster: artifacts already published
# verify against THIS key forever, so its lifecycle is deliberately decoupled
# from the infrastructure that signs with or verifies against it.
#
# Two properties make a KMS key cosign-appropriate, and both are immutable
# after creation:
#
#   - key_usage SIGN_VERIFY - an ENCRYPT_DECRYPT key (the KMS default) cannot
#     sign at all.
#   - an asymmetric signing spec cosign supports - ECC_NIST_P256 by default,
#     matching cosign's own default algorithm (ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256).
#
# Publishers sign with `cosign sign --key awskms:///<key-arn>`; verifiers need
# only the public half (kms:GetPublicKey, or the exported PEM), never the
# private key, which never leaves KMS.
#
# There is deliberately no enable_key_rotation here: KMS cannot auto-rotate
# asymmetric keys, and rotating a signing key is not an operational nicety but
# an identity change - every consumer must be re-pointed and existing
# signatures no longer match. Rotation, when needed, is a new key plus
# re-signing, coordinated by humans. For the same reason the deletion window
# defaults to the maximum: deleting this key permanently breaks verification
# of everything ever signed with it.
