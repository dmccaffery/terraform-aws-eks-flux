    single-region: the ARN works from any region, and verification is a rare, tiny, read-only call.

    KMS needs both this key-policy grant and an identity policy on the caller (artifact-store attaches the latter when
    given this key's ARN via signing_kms_key_arn). Same-account signers need only their identity policy and can leave
