# PUSH: the two GitHub Actions publishers, through the account's GitHub OIDC
# provider. These are the only long-lived identities the platform has - every
# in-cluster workload uses EKS Pod Identity instead.
#
# PULL: nothing by default except the ECR pull-through cache service, and that
# ORG-WIDE rather than per-account, so a new cluster account onboards without
# touching this module. Clusters read the store through a cache in their own
# account (modules/registry-cache); direct_pull_principals is the escape hatch
# for the ones the platform team lets read it straight.
