# The platform artifact store: every artifact the clusters consume, under path
# namespaces beneath one ECR prefix - 
#
#   <prefix>/charts/<name>            helm charts mirrored by flux-containers
#   <prefix>/images/<original-path>   digest-pinned images mirrored by flux-containers
#   <prefix>/flux-manifests           the signed OCI manifests artifact synced by FluxInstance
#
# ECR has no arbitrary-path model: every one of those is a real repository that
# must exist before a push. A REPOSITORY CREATION TEMPLATE with CREATE_ON_PUSH
# is what restores Artifact Registry's ergonomics - publishers simply push, and
# ECR creates each repository with this template's lifecycle policy, tag
# mutability, encryption and tags. Without a matching template ECR refuses to
# create on push at all, so the template is essential, not a nicety.
#
# There is no signing key anywhere in this module: artifacts are cosign-signed
# KEYLESSLY by the publishing GitHub Actions workflows (OIDC -> Fulcio/Rekor),
# and consumers verify against the workflows' certificate identities. The only
# infrastructure signing needs is the GitHub OIDC trust below, which controls
# who may PUSH.
