# wiring, reserved Gateway addresses, RBAC access entries, SSO, the staging sync
# channel, pre-created workload namespaces and extra cluster vars / kustomize
# patches. This is the shape a real patchy deployment root will take.
#
# PREREQUISITES this example does not create (they live upstream):
#
#   - the VPC, its private node subnets and public subnets, with NAT or the
#     ECR/S3/STS/EKS VPC endpoints nodes need to pull images and reach the API
#   - the delegated Route53 hosted zone, with NS records added at the parent once
#   - the artifact store (examples/artifact-store), populated by flux-containers
#
# Subnets must carry the kubernetes.io/role/{internal-,}elb tags for the
# Gateway's NLB; the cluster module adds the karpenter.sh/discovery tag itself
# unless network.manage_discovery_tags is turned off.
