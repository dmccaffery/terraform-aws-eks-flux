# A pull-through cache of the platform artifact store, applied in a consuming
# team's own account and region. This is how a cluster is meant to reach the
# store: images come from a registry beside the nodes, and the store stays
# closed to direct reads.
#
# Nothing needs to change in the store to onboard this account - its registry
# policy admits the whole organization's pull-through caches by
# aws:PrincipalOrgID.
#
# Its platform_registry output goes straight into the cluster module, carrying
# is_pull_through_cache = true so the cluster's pullers get the create/import
# permissions a cache needs on first pull.
