# The static addresses for the platform Gateway. Cilium's Gateway API
# implementation materialises exactly one LoadBalancer Service per Gateway
# (cilium-gateway-<name>), which the AWS Load Balancer Controller turns into an
# NLB bound to these Elastic IPs - one per subnet the NLB spans, which is an NLB
# requirement rather than a per-host one. Every HTTPRoute hostname then shares
# that one address set, so adding a host is manifests-only: an HTTPRoute plus
# the external-dns record, no terraform change.
#
# Living outside the Gateway's lifecycle means cluster destroy/recreate serves
# the same addresses again: external-dns records barely blip and the domain
# comes back without manual action. The flux-manifests gateway component
# attaches them by allocation id through the GATEWAY_EIP_ALLOCATIONS cluster
# var (spec.infrastructure.annotations ->
# service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-eip-allocations).
#
# Two shapes: reserve them here (reserve_static_ip, the default), or reference
# existing allocations by id (reserve_static_ip = false + allocation_ids), the
# way a cloud-accounts-owned reservation would arrive.
#
# A private Gateway (var.gateway.private) is an internal NLB: it spans the
# node subnets rather than the public ones and cannot carry Elastic IPs, so
# the whole EIP surface here goes inert (validation keeps allocation_ids
# empty) and stability comes from the private zone's records instead.
