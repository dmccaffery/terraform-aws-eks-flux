# The delegated Route53 hosted zone (e.g. patchy.bitwisemedia.co.uk) is created
# upstream and delegated from the parent domain once — it deliberately lives
# outside this module so cluster destroy/recreate never touches the zone or its
# NS delegation. This module only looks it up: validating it exists, deriving
# the domain for the Gateway/certificate wiring, and passing the ids through
# to external-dns via cluster vars. The PUBLIC flavour always exists —
# cert-manager's DNS-01 challenges resolve over public DNS, so even a fully
# internal cluster keeps a public zone for certificate issuance. The private
# flavour (var.dns.private_zone) is the split-horizon addition: a private
# zone under the same name, associated with the cluster VPC, shadowing the
# public one for in-VPC resolution; external-dns runs one instance per
# flavour, publishing the same records into each.
