# The per-cluster SSO client pairs between dex and its in-cluster relying
# parties (the Flux status web UI, the patchy status page). These are internal
# shared secrets with the cluster's lifecycle -- generated here, never entered
# out of band: each value is an ephemeral random_password written through
# write-only attributes, so it exists in Secrets Manager and nowhere else (not
# in state, not in plan). The manifests stack syncs each secret into its
# consumer namespaces under the same SECRET_PREFIX this module publishes.
#
# Two consumers need the value INLINE in a composed config document rather than
# as a raw key:
#   - flux-web-auth-config: the flux-operator Web Config API document (the
#     operator accepts no file or env indirection). Written from the same
#     ephemeral value as the raw dex-client-flux-web secret in the same apply,
#     so the pair cannot drift.
#   - patchy-status-auth-config: patchy's status server DOES support
#     clientSecretFile, so its document is secretless and both sides read the
#     one dex-client-patchy-status version.
#
# Everything here follows the optional-tier election (stack_components) and
# requires the DNS surface (issuer and redirect URLs need the domain): an
# unelected relying party gets no client, no secret, no grants.
#
# dex federates to whatever upstream identity provider sso.connector
# declares; local.dex_connectors normalizes that declaration (defaulting
# id and name, injecting a shared redirectURI) into the shape flux.tf
# publishes as DEX_CONNECTORS. The dex-<id>-<field> credential containers
# the declaration implies live in modules/secrets, instantiated in a
# durable root and fed the same sso value verbatim (applying the same
# id-defaults-to-type rule, so the naming cannot drift) -- an upstream
# OAuth client outlives any one cluster, so its out-of-band credentials
# must too. The prefix-scoped reader roles (iam.tf) make them readable
# here the moment the cluster exists.
