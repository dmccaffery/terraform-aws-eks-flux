# Cilium in ENI mode - the CNI, the kube-proxy replacement and the Gateway API
# implementation, with the AWS VPC CNI never installed.
#
# ENI mode rather than an overlay because pods must hold routable VPC
# addresses: the control plane reaches admission webhooks directly, the
# Gateway's NLB can target pod IPs, and the datapath matches what vpc-cni would
# have given us. It also makes raw CiliumNetworkPolicy / FQDNNetworkPolicy
# usable, which managed Cilium distributions typically reject.
#
# This is the ONLY helm release in the root module, and it exists here rather
# than in flux for one reason: a node cannot report Ready without a CNI, so
# nothing flux-managed can be the CNI. The release is bootstrap-only
# (ignore_changes), exactly like the flux-operator/flux-instance pair, so the
# stack's cilium component adopts it by name and upgrades ship by publishing to
# the registry rather than by terraform apply.
